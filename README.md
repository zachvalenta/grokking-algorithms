# OVERVIEW

This repo is a record of working through the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms).

My implementations are in Python. The author maintains a [repo](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms) of the book's examples implemented across many different languages.

# algos

* _search_: simple, binary
* _sort_: selection
* _recursion_: sum, factorial
